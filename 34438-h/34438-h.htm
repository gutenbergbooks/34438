<h1>The Troubles<br />
of Biddy</h1>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">"Oh dear," sighed old Biddy, just under her breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I really am troubled and worried to death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For months I have thought of a family, dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To gladden my heart, and to live with me here.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">"But daily I find that my plans are upset,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all I can do is to sit here and fret&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I haven't a sign of an egg in my nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though some I have laid are as good as the best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">"I&nbsp;scolded last night when my mistress came near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But though she was bitten, she seemed not to fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She only said, 'Biddy, what are you about?'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then through the doorway she simply passed out.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">"I&nbsp;don't understand it; I cannot see why;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For surely to be a good mother I'd try;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although I would see that they did as I said!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Biddy, in sorrow and grief hung her head.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">So deep was the longing of poor Biddy's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She felt that with life she was ready to part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But glancing about in her trouble and pain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She saw that her mistress was coming again;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<div class="pg">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">And noting the basket she held in her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old Biddy thought quickly "she can't understand,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "what is she doing?" exclaimed in surprise;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For out of the nest Biddy felt herself rise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">As Biddy stood resting her poor weary legs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She saw that the basket contained shining eggs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mistress with care placed them all in the nest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Biddy to snuggle beneath her warm breast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">Now Biddy was happy; her burden was gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her troubles had vanished, she felt she had none:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, planning away in her little straw bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No thoughts of complaining came into her head.<br /></span>

</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">She looked from the window each morning at dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pictures of rapture were constantly drawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, out on the lawn near a little old shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were dishes and troughs where the chickens were fed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">And Biddy thought wisely, "These things I shall use;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The largest and neatest are what I shall choose."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never a thought did this wise mother take<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of danger, or trouble, in St. Mary's lake.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">How happy she was when the first sounds were heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the bright downy heads her soft feathers stirred!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But what is the matter with each little nose?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She said in amazement, "And what ails their toes?"<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">"They are not like chickens at all, I am sure!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wonder whatever such strange things will cure?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Biddy once more was in trouble most deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For none of her children could really say peep.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">"I&nbsp;think that my babes for a walk ought to go;"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One morning said Biddy, "I'll lead them just so;<br /></span>

<span class="i0cap">At the word every downy ball hustled about,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ere Biddy knew it, they all had jumped out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the nest, and were darting about in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For bugs, and for grass blades, and simply for fun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">Biddy watched for a time and then softly said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I ought to be dusting my feathers and head;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So off to the roadside she hastily went,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there in the soft sand, a few moments spent.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">What was it made Biddy's heart quiver and leap?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It wasn't the sound of a young chicken's peep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the splashing of water and flutt'ring of wings&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And leaving the road side she screamed, "Of all things!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">Her babies were all in the watering trough,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Regardless of sickness, disease, and of cough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh dear," cried poor Biddy, "What now shall I do?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My children will drown and before my eyes too!"<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">Where apples were juicy and mellow, one day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These ten naughty children were gathered to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When suddenly one of them, leading the band,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said, "Come, let us travel," and there a trip planned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">So off they all went toward the shed and the pump,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Turning out now and then for a log or a stump,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down the steep hill where the clover bloomed bright<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The little band wandered in perfect delight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">The moment that Biddy discovered the plot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She rushed in confusion and soon reached the spot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh children, be careful!" she screamed in alarm;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"In the lake I'm sure you will meet with some harm!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">But to cry, and protest, and urge them to come<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seemed all of no use, for they would not go home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Biddy exclaimed to herself in disgust,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"To stand this I cannot, and leave them I must!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0cap">The evening shades gathered that night in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wind sung most softly a sweet lula-by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Biddy had left her dear children alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She found they were ducklings, and such could not own.<br /></span>
